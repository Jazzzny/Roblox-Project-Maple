Project Maple Open Source
=========
This is the open source build of Project Maple, a bus simulator game on Roblox featuring the Route 39 Finch East from Toronto.
This build is a modified version of v1.2 beta from late August 2020. It has been made public so new Roblox developers can learn the basics of a bus simulation game.

To get started, download the "Project Maple v1.2 Open Source.rbxl" file and open it in studio. Everything is set up and ready to go.
